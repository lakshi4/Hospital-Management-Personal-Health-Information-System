- Implementing **CRUD functionality for treatment details**, including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting treatment records
- Designing MongoDB schema and backend routes for treatment data
- Building React components to display and manage treatment forms and tables
- Ensuring data integrity and smooth client-server communication using RESTful APIs

## ✨ Key Features (in Hospital Module)
